ðŸ‘‹  Hi, I am Jonnatan Jossemar Cordero, and this is my 3Pillar consultant account (@jossemargt-3pillar). If you want to check the projects I work on in my spare time, then simply remove the corporate suffix from this account handle.

ðŸ‘€ Have you heard about [K3S](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s) and [RKE2](https://github.com/rancher/rke2) Kubernetes distributions? If you don't, go and explore those marvelous projects! The former is my favorite ðŸ¤« . By the way, I got the chance to assist their core maintainers in documenting and automating their release processes, and it has been a blast.

ðŸŒ± I don't know what comes in the future, but I can assure you I have enjoyed the process so far.
