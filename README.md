ðŸ‘‹  Hi, I am Jonnatan Jossemar Cordero, and this is my 3Pillar consultant account (@jossemargt-3pillar). If you want to check the projects I work on in my spare time, the only thing you need to do is to drop the corporate suffix from this account handle ;)

ðŸ‘€ Currently, I assist k3s/rke2 maintainers in automating and documenting their processes. These kubernetes distributions are way so awesome! And it took me a while to get a better notion of them, so I am looking forward to easing that learning curve for future contributors.

ðŸŒ± I am versed in different programming languages. So instead of keep polishing my hard skills, I am investing more in the soft ones. Currently, I am interested in management and communication.
