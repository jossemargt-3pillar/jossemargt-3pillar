ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Jonnatan Jossemar Cordero and this is my 3Pillar consultant account (@jossemargt-3pillar). If you want to check the projects I work in my spare time the only thing you need to do is to drop the corporate suffix from this account handle ;) 

ðŸ‘€ Currently, I am assisgting k3s/rke2 maintainers to automate and document their processes. These kubernetes distributions are way so awesome! And it took me a while to get a better notion of them, so I am looking forward to ease that learning curve for future contributors.

ðŸŒ± I am versed on different programming languages. So instead of keep polishing my hard skills, I am investing more on the soft ones. Currently, I am interested on management and communication.
